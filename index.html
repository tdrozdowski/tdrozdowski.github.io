            Welcome to xymox.net.
        </h3>

        <p>What is xymox.net?  Its my private domain that I've heald since 1996 or so.  I've not done too much with it, but with the advent of Github and social programming, I've brought it back to life here.  Xymox is reference to the gothic-electro band <a href="http://clanofxymox.com/">Clan of Xymox</a> from the Netherlands. They have nothing to do with this site, except provide inspiration through their great music.</p>
        <p>What will you find here? This site is a collection of various GitHub projects, discussions and examples of various things that I find interesting in the software world.  Not quite a blog, but a link to things I'm working on in GitHub that are kinda cool and interesting.</p>

        <p>The underlying technologies of what you find here will change from time to time.  Currently, I am an advocate of the Play Framework and the Typesafe Stack with Scala.  I am also an advocate of AngularJS, CoffeeScript and Yeoman.</p>

        </h3>

        <p>I am presenting a session at the Desert Code Camp on Nov 9th, 2013 entitled: Play Framework with Scala in Action.  This is my first attempt at giving such a presentation, so hopefully all goes well. :)</p>

        <p>Requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>JDK 6 or JDK 7 (for JVM)</li>

            <li>A text editor (VI, EMACs, Sublime) or IDE (<a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/IDEA+13+EAP">IntelliJ 13 EAP</a> with Scala & Play 2 plugins was used building these examples)</li>
            <li>A MongoDB instance (<a href="http://mongohq.com">MongoHQ</a> has a nice, free sandbox instance with 512MB)</li>

        </h3>

        <p>I have presented a session at the Phoenix Mongo Users group on ReactiveMongo - an asynchronous driver for MongoDB in Scala</p>

        <p>The following is a link to the two projects in GitHub I used to build the sample app for.  They are based on Play Framework 2.1.x and ReactiveMongo 0.9.  Please note that these have changed considerably in just a few short months as Play 2.2 and 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT of ReactiveMongo are now current.  However, they should provide some decent examples. </p>
